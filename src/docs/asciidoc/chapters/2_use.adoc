=== Using the Gradle Wrapper

[source]
----
./gradlew tasks
----

Note the implicit invocation from the project root.
With Gradle, no need to navigate inside project directories.
Instead, you can pass a specific task name and path to execute.

=== Invoking tasks

[source]
----
./gradlew [taskName...] [--option-name...]
----

Where `taskName` is one or more tasks names, space separated.

Each task can also reference a specific task in a subproject:

[source]
----
./gradlew :server:test
----

=== Interesting options

* `--exclude-task` or `-x`: To exclude one task from the execution graph
[source]
----
./gradlew build -x test
----
* `--continue`: To continue with the build even when a task fails
** Note: The dependents task(s) of the failed one will still not be executed.
[source]
----
./gradlew test --continue
----

=== Task execution graph

A Gradle build is really about executing a set of tasks that produce the needed output.
The scope of the set is determined by the tasks requested on the command line and all tasks they depend upon.

=== Logging

* Gradle defines 6 log levels: `error`, `quiet`, `warning`, `lifecycle`, `info`, `debug`
* Default log level (`lifecycle`) is minimalistic
* Command line flags allow to set a different level:
[source]
----
> gradle hello -i
> gradle -q hello
----

When troubleshooting, `info` should be your first stop as `debug` has a _lot_ of output.
