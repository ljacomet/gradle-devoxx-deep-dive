== Anatomy of a Gradle project

Gradle is based on a set of conventions.

Some inherited from the history of Java build systems:

* `src/main/java`
* `src/test/resources`

Others brought by Gradle:

* The name of the project is the name of the containing folder

=== A multi project build

=== The build file

* By default, named `build.gradle` which can be configured.
* Describes what the build is about through configuration.

=== Companion files

* `settings.gradle`: Configure the project(s) that compose the build
* `gradle.properties`: Defines properties specific to the build, which can be overridden

=== Additional build artifacts

Directories:

* `buildSrc`
* `.gradle`
* `build`

=== The Gradle Wrapper

[%step]
* Bootstraps Gradle for project contributors
* Project controls Gradle version

=== Gradle daemon

By default, Gradle will start a background process to execute your builds.

This allows to have a warmed up JVM running your build instead of having a fresh one each time.

[%step]
* `org.gradle.daemon` can be used to disable the daemon
* `org.gradle.daemon.idletimeout` can be used to tweak the idle time

=== Parallel builds

Gradle can run tasks of decoupled projects in parallel

[%step]
* `org.gradle.parallel` can be used to disable parallel mode
* `org.gradle.workers.max` can be used to limit the number of workers used by parallel builds
** Defaults to number of CPUs
