== Up to date and incremental tasks

=== UP-TO-DATE

It is the task level expression of Gradle efficiency,

By describing the inputs and outputs of a task, Gradle can determine if it is _up to date_.

And of course, an _up to date_ task can be skipped during execution.

=== Inputs / Outputs

A task needs to describe:

* Its input / output files
* Its input / output dirs
* Input properties

=== Incremental build

A task is UP-TO-DATE iff:

* Inputs have not changed
* Outputs are still present and un-tampered

=== Change detection

* Hash of input / output files
* Hash of contents of input / output folders
* Serialize input properties

=== Control change detection

* `--rerun-tasks` bypasses up-to-date checks
* Running at _info_ level will give you insights in up-to-date calculations

=== Gotchas

Adding a timestamp to a jar manifest will make the jar task always out of date.

What if you do want / need that? Maybe you could only do it for a release build.
