== IDE integration

=== Plugins

IntelliJ Idea and Eclipse both have a dedicated Gradle plugin.

These plugins enable the generation of configuration files for the respective IDEs.

However integration goes much farther than that for both.

=== IntelliJ Idea

The recommended way of integrating a Gradle project in IntelliJ Idea is simply to import it.

This will enable compiling and running tests for most projects.

Changes to the Gradle build will make the IDE prompt for a refresh, unles automatic import is enabled.


=== Advanced Idea integration

The IDE also enables delegating actions to Gradle, like compilation and test execution.

=== Customizing Idea integration

Through the application of the `idea` plugin, you can control the configuration of the IDE project.

This enables projects that have a particular setup to still integrate well with the IDE.

For example, you will be able to configure test run / debug configurations
so that the extra properties passed from Gradle are also used in the IDE.

=== Eclipse Buildship

Buildship is the Eclipse subproject that allows deep Gradle integration into the IDE.

Once you have Buildship available as a plugin, you can simply import exising Gradle projects.

Changes to the Gradle build need to be explicitly imported via _Refresh Gradle Project_.
